Title: I built the world's first hyperfocus-aware 3D repository visualization (ADHD developer's dream tool)

As someone with ADHD who's always struggled with traditional portfolio sites and research papers, I decided to build something that actually works with my brain instead of against it.

The result? A dual-mode 3D constellation where you can:
• Explore repositories in 3D space (37+ of mine visualized)  
• Navigate interactive research about "vibe coding" and hyperfocus
• Track focus sessions with achievement systems
• Toggle between repository and research modes seamlessly

Built with accessibility-first principles:
• WCAG 2.1 AA compliant (100% keyboard navigable)
• Screen reader optimized with full ARIA
• Works perfectly on mobile with touch controls
• Respects motion sensitivity preferences

The crazy part? Building it for neurodivergent minds made it better for everyone. The focus modes, clear navigation, and calm interface design benefits all users.

GitHub: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ultimate-hyperfocus-constellation

Would love feedback from other neurodivergent developers - does this kind of interface work better for your brain too?

Tech stack: Three.js, WebGL, GitHub API, vanilla JS (no frameworks to keep it fast)

Subreddits: r/webdev, r/ADHD, r/accessibility, r/threejs, r/javascript
