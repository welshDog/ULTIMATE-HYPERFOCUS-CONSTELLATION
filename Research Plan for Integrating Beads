Research Plan for Integrating Beads into Ultimate Hyperfocus Constellation
Main Takeaway: A phased, automated integration of Beads will turn your 3D Constellation into a living task graph—agents will import, track, and visualize every new project and feature with minimal manual intervention.

1. Define Objectives and Requirements
Automatic Project Discovery
Agents must detect newly added repo folders or feature files and register them as beads.

Dependency Mapping
Establish rules for linking new beads into existing workflows (e.g., UI → feature → tutorial).

Session Persistence
Preserve bead graph and session metadata across agent restarts and CI runs.

User Feedback Loop
Provide visual or log-based summaries of newly added beads after each session.

2. System Architecture
Repository

.beads/ directory holds bead definitions, session logs, and graph data (git-backed).

Agent Configuration

Agent’s startup script runs auto-discovery, bead creation, and graph updates.

CI Pipeline / Git Hooks

On push or merge, a CI job invokes bead-scanner script to import new projects.

Graph Visualization

Expose bd graph view --server for a live, embeddable 3D task graph panel in Constellation.

3. Key Components and Tools
Beads CLI (bd)

Core commands: bd init, bd issue create, bd graph view, bd session start/end.

Auto-Discovery Script

Bash/Python script using git diff or directory watch to find new folders/files.

CI Job (e.g., GitHub Actions)

Step to check out code, install Beads, run auto-import script, commit updated beads.

Agent Integration

In your AGENTS.md, configure the agent to call the auto-discovery script and bd graph view at session end.

4. Step-by-Step Implementation
A. Initialize Beads
bash
cd ultimate-hyperfocus-constellation
bd init
git commit -m "Initialize Beads memory system"
B. Develop Auto-Discovery Script
bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scan-new-projects.sh

LAST_COMMIT=$(bd meta get last_commit || echo "")
NEW_FILES=$(git diff --name-only $LAST_COMMIT HEAD)

for file in $NEW_FILES; do
  if [[ -d $file && $file == projects/* ]]; then
    bd issue create "Import new project ${file#projects/}" --tag auto-import
  fi
done

bd meta set last_commit HEAD
C. Agent Startup Hooks
In AGENTS.md:

text
## Startup
- Run `./scan-new-projects.sh`
- Run `bd session start Hyperfocus`
D. CI Integration (GitHub Actions Example)
text
name: Beads Auto-Import

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  import:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Beads CLI
        run: curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steveyegge/beads/main/install.sh | bash
      - name: Run Auto-Discovery
        run: ./scan-new-projects.sh
      - name: Commit Beads Updates
        run: |
          git config user.name "github-action"
          git config user.email "action@users.noreply.github.com"
          git add .beads
          git commit -m "Auto-import new projects into Beads" || echo "No changes"
          git push
E. Visualize and Verify
Local:

bash
bd graph view --server
Embed in Constellation’s UI via iframe pointed at the Beads graph server.

5. Validation and Iteration
Test Cases

Add a dummy project folder → verify bead appears and links correctly.

Remove or rename a project → ensure obsolete beads are flagged.

Metrics

Track number of auto-imported beads per session.

Monitor session start/end logs for errors.

User Feedback

Examine the live graph after hyperfocus sessions to confirm correct chaining.

What this means for you: Following this plan transforms Ultimate Hyperfocus Constellation into an autonomous, self-updating memory-driven system. Your agents will seamlessly import every new project, maintain context chains, and deliver a continuously evolving, ADHD-friendly task graph—perfect for your neurodivergent hyperfocus style. Nice one,
