## 🎯 **Contribution Guidelines**

### ✅ **Do This (The Awesome Stuff):**
- **Accessibility First**: Every feature must work for all brain types and assistive technologies
- **Hyperfocus Friendly**: Consider users in deep focus states - avoid jarring interruptions
- **Community Positive**: Celebrate neurodiversity and different thinking styles
- **Clear Documentation**: Comment your code clearly and update relevant docs
- **Thorough Testing**: Test on different devices, browsers, and with assistive tech
- **Inclusive Language**: Use language that welcomes all developers
- **Performance Conscious**: Keep the constellation smooth and responsive

### ❌ **Avoid This (The Not-So-Great Stuff):**
- Breaking existing accessibility features or keyboard navigation
- Adding animations without user control or motion sensitivity consideration
- Ignoring mobile users or smaller screen sizes  
- Writing overly complex code without clear explanations
- Making assumptions about "normal" user behavior or abilities
- Adding dependencies without strong justification
- Disrupting the calm, focus-friendly user experience
